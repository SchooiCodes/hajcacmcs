# How to host a crossplay, any version and cracked Minecraft server for free  
  
*This is a comprehensive tutorial made by me, Schooi (pronounced Skui) (@schooi. on Discord, SchooiCodes on Github) on how to* host *and* join **crossplay, any-version and cracked** *Minecraft servers..*  
*The tutorial is split into 2 parts:* **Hosting** and **Joining**  
This seems like a lot of text, but not all things are needed to be read, so please be patient and don't get scared by the sheer size of the tutorial.  
  
## Hosting  
### Requirements  
The only requirements are:  
1. A Minecraft launcher  
2. An Aternos account  
  
For cracked Minecraft:  
- SKLauncher  
  
For purchased Minecraft:  
- Prism Launcher  
- Minecraft Launcher  
- Any client (eg. Lunar, Badlion) you want.  
  
If you don't have an Aternos account, see **Creating an Aternos account**  
If you already have one, log into it at https://aternos.org/go/.  
  
### Creating an Aternos account  
To create an account, go to https://aternos.org/signup/.  
There, choose a username for the account, switch the checkboxes on and click "**Next**".   
Then, choose a password and optionally add an e-mail for recovery. Alternatively, log in with Google.  
  
### Creating the server  
Once signed in to Aternos, head over to https://aternos.org/servers/.  
There, press "**Create a server**".  
Then, change the name and MOTD if you want.   
**Do not change the platform of the server. Keep it on "Java Edition"**.  
Press "**Create**".  
If you want to backup your server, follow the steps. Otherwise, press skip.  
You should find yourself on https://aternos.org/server/.  
  
### Making it playable on any version  
While at https://aternos.org/server/, you should see a side panel on the left of the webpage.  
There, press "**Software**" (https://aternos.org/software/).  
Choose "**Paper / Bukkit**" (https://aternos.org/software/papermc/).  
Choose the latest version, or the version your world is in if you are following this tutorial with a pre-existing server.  
Press "**Install**".  
After it is installed, press the following link: https://aternos.org/addons/a/modrinthbukkit/P1OZGk5p  
Press the install button on the latest version.  
Wait for it to install.  
Do the same thing with these 2 other plugins:  
https://aternos.org/addons/a/modrinthbukkit/TbHIxhx5  
https://aternos.org/addons/a/modrinthbukkit/NpvuJQoq  
After you do that, you will have a server that can be joined on any Minecraft version.  
  
### Making it crossplay  
To make the server crossplay, another plugin needs to be installed.  
Install the following plugin: https://aternos.org/addons/a/artemis-bukkit/geyser  
Then, the next time you start the server, it will be automatically crossplay.  
  
### Making it cracked  
On the side panel, press "**Options**" (https://aternos.org/options/)  
Scroll down until you find the "**Cracked**" setting. Enable it.  
The server is now set up for cracked clients.  
  
---  
That sums up the **Hosting** part of the tutorial. You may change any other settings you want, as long as you do not somehow tamper with the tweaks we have applied.  
  
## Joining  
To join the server, it will have to be open.  
To start the server, go to https://aternos.org/server/ and press "**Start**"  
Before we proceed, you will need the following info:  
1. The Server IP  
2. The Server Port  
  
To obtain the previous information, press "**Server**" on the side panel of the Aternos webpage (https://aternos.org/server/).  
After that, press "**Connect**" under the server's IP.  
Note the info somewhere.  
  
### Java Edition  
The full address of your server in Java Edition is the following:  
**[Server IP]:[Server Port]**  
eg. example.aternos.me:12345  
In the Multiplayer menu,  you can either add the server or join it directly.  
To add the server, press "**Add Server**" in the bottom right.  
Name the server however you want. ("**Server Name**" textbox)  
In the address box, type or paste the full address of your server.  
Press "**Done**".  
Then, double click on the server in the menu to join it, or press the play button that appears on its icon.  
  
### Bedrock Edition  
In the main menu, press "**Play**".   
Find the "**Servers**" tab.  
Find the "**Add Server**" button.  
Don't see this button? See "**Joining servers without having the "Add Server" button**"  
Name the server however you want ("**Server Name**" textbox)  
In the "**Server Address**" textbox, type or paste the server's address.  
In the "**Server Port**" textbox, type or paste the server's port.  
  
Example:  
Server Address: example.aternos.me  
Server Port: 12345  
Full address (Java Edition) (Comparison only): example.aternos.me:12345  
  
Press "**Save**".  
Join the server.  
  
### Joining servers without having the "Add Server" button  
  
We will utilize **Realms** as a workaround.  
Find and navigate to the "**Realms**" tab.  
Find and press the "**Add/join Realm**" button.  
Don't see it? See "**Other workarounds.**".  
There, press "**Join an existing Realm**"  
In the "**Invite Link**" textbox, type or paste the following **code** or **invite link**:  
Code: **gMAHyBCCj9W-fNg**  
Invite link: **https://realms.gg/gMAHyBCCj9W-fNg**  
Press "**Join**".  
Press "**Join**" again.  
Press "**Play**"  
After joining, find the "**Join any server**" NPC.  
Open its menu and add the server.  
Then join it.  
  
### Other workarounds  
If you don't see the "**Add/join Realm**" button, there are a few things you can do.  
  
#### The friend method  
Find and go to the "**Friends**" tab.  
Press "**Add Friend**".  
Search for "**TheServerHub**"  
Don't see it? See "**Obtaining the old UI and using that to join the Realm**"  
Add him as a friend.  
In the friends tab, join the "**TheServerHub**" Realm.   
Follow the rest of the steps to join your server.  
  
#### Obtaining the old UI and using that to join the Realm  
First, go to the "**Servers**" tab.  
Join the **Hive**.  
Open the chat menu.  
Type "**/region oc**".  
Press "**Yes, take me to Oceania!**"  
Wait a bit, it should say "**Invalid IP!**" and kick you out.  
Exit the error menu and you should have the old "**Play**" menu.  
Go to the "**Realms**" tab.  
Add the realm like you normally would and follow the rest of the steps.  
**Make sure you ADD the realm so that it shows up in the Realms menu regardless. Otherwise you will have to repeat this process every single time.**
